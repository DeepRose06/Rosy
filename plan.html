    <h1>Goals:</h1>
    <p>Concisely state what the goal (purpose) of the website is. Note that the mission must be to improve something in a measurable way. To "provide information about something" is not a good mission, since you can't see a measurable improvement. Why is the site needed? How does it benefit the client? Be clear and specific. Good mission statements are usually only a few sentences and contain no unnecessary information.</p>
    <h1>Success Evaluation:</h1>
    <p>Describe the process(es) by which the site's success will be evaluated. Note that "hits" only counts people (or robots) visiting your website, which says nothing about whether the site has achieved its mission. How do you know that the site does what the client wanted? Measure the mission you stated above.</p>
    <h1>Target Audience:</h1>
    <p>Describe two things clearly and specifically: 1. the target audience that your site is intended for (be specific; you can't aim for everyone) 2. how you will intentionally design the site to cater to this group (as distinct from another, different target audience).</p>
